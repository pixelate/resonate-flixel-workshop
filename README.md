resonate-flixel-workshop
========================

During the workshop each participant will design and program a unique character for a simple 2D-action game using the Flash-based game framework Flixel. In the game two players compete against each other in a virtual arena. At the beginning of a match, each player is randomly assigned one of the characters with a unique set of features and properties, allowing for asymmetric game play.

Participants will learn how to create interesting game interactions within an existing structure, and how to collaborate on a project in a parallel fashion. Each contributed game character will directly affect the game play, evoking discussion about what makes a game balanced, coherent, diverse and enjoyable. The finished game including all contributed characters will be released as open source on GitHub.
